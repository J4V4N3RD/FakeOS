# FakeOS

In this project I have re-created the windows 95 operating system (not historically accurate).

This was done by combining my knowledge of HTML, SCSS and a newly acquired skill Javascript.

After designing the basic HTML and css elements, I added javascript for the following items:

-Current and working clock, that displays the time, date, and day

-Responsive start menu that can be opened with one click

-Responsive menus attached to the start menu that can be opened with a double click and closed with one click

-Responsive Icons that can be highlighted on first click and opened with 2 clicks.

-Applications that when opened have their own design, while keeping in line with the general OS design.

-One of the applications is a 'MSN' chat system that outputs the userInput into the chat box.

Thankyou for taking the time to read about my project, and enjoy what I have created. I look forward to creating more advanced and complex designs in the future.
